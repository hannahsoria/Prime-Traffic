# Prime-Traffic

Description:
In the first part of this project the goal is to create a circuit that reflects the prime numbers possible with 4 bits. This means in a 4 bit truth table a 1 will be outputted if the number is a prime number. Through creating a circuit, a VHDL, and a testbench the circuit can be simulated as a ghdl waveform. In the second part of the project the goal is to create a circuit that reflects a 4 way intersection with lights that change based on time. In total there are 6 lights, 3 north/south and 3 east/west, that change accordingly. Similarly to the prime portion of the project, once a circuit, VHDL, and trafficbench is created the circuit can be simulated as a ghdl waveform.

This is the final circuit for the Prime Finder.
